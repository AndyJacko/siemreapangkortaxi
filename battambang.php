                <h1>Battambang</h1>
                <p>Battambang is the capital city of Battambang province in north western Cambodia.</p>
                <p>Founded in the 11th century by the Khmer Empire, Battambang is well known for being the leading rice-producing province of the country. For nearly 100 years, it was a major commercial hub and provincial capital of Siamese province of Inner Cambodia (1795-1907), though it was always populated by Khmer with a mix of ethnic Vietnamese, Lao, Thai and Chinese. Still today Battambang is the main hub of the Northwest connecting the entire region with Phnom Penh and Thailand, and as such itâ€™s a vital link to Cambodia.</p>
                <p>The city is situated by the Sangkae River, a tranquil, small body of water that winds its way through Battambang Province providing its nice picturesque setting. As with much of Cambodia, the French Colonial architecture is an attractive bonus of the city. It is home to some of the best preserved French colonial architecture in the country.</p>

                  <p>Banan Temple located some 25 km south of Battambang City, has been likened to a smaller version of the more imposing Angkor Wat. Built in the 10th century, it is very popular at weekends with Khmer families out on picnics.</p>

                  <p><strong>Bamboo Train</strong></p>
                  <p>The trains have low fares, are frequent and relatively fast, so are popular despite their rudimentary design, lack of brakes, the state of the rails (often broken or warped) and lack of any formal operating regime.</p>
