                  <p>Kun took us to Angkor Wat and several other temples on a 1 day tour in January 2016. It was really hot, so being driven around in a nice cool car was a bonus. Kun took great care of us the whole time. We would recommend Siem Reap Angkor Taxi.</p>

                  <p>I used Siem Reap Angkor Taxi service back in December 2015 for a trip from Siem Reap to Phnom Penh. The driver was very friendly and a very safe driver on roads that are not much more than dirt tracks. Next time I am in Siem Reap I will use Kun's services again.</p>

                  <p>Very good service. Fast, cheap and was always on time. I used Siem Reap Angkor Taxi service in August 2015 on the small tour of Angkor Wat.</p>

                  <p>My wife and I were staying in Siem Reap in June 2015 and had bad luck with some of the local tuk-tuk drivers overcharging us. We met Kun from Siem Reap Angkor Taxi who took us to the Floating Village at Tonle Sap Lake. He was very nice and we used him for the rest of our holiday after that. Very friendly driver.</p>

                  <p>I have used Siem Reap Angkor Taxi service for the past couple of years when I visit Siem Reap on business. Mr Kun is very friendly and has a lot of knowledge of Siem Reap and the Angkor Wat temples. The taxi is always kept clean and cool.</p>
