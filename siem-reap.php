                <h1>Siem Reap</h1>
                <p>Siem Reap is the capital city of Siem Reap Province in northwestern Cambodia, and a popular resort town as the gateway to Angkor region.</p>
                <p>Siem Reap has colonial and Chinese-style architecture in the Old French Quarter, and around the Old Market. In the city, there are museums, traditional Apsara dance performances, a Cambodian cultural village, souvenir and handycraft shops, silk farms, rice-paddies in the countryside, fishing villages and a bird sanctuary near the Tonle Sap Lake.</p>
                <p>Siem Reap today—being a popular tourist destination—has a large number of hotels, resorts, restaurants and businesses closely related to tourism. This is much owed to its proximity to the Angkor temples, the most popular tourist attraction in Cambodia.</p>

                  <p><strong>Angkor Wat</strong></p>
                  <p>Angkor Wat is one of the largest monuments to religion ever built and is truly one the wonders of the world. Believed to have been constructed as a temple and mausoleum for King Suryavarman II at the peak of the Khmer empire in the 12th century.</p>

                  <p><strong>Pub Street</strong></p>
                  <p>Pub Street is Siem Reap's party hub, so grab a drink (or a scoop of Siem Reap's best ice cream at Blue Pumpkin) and soak it all up. Check out the Red Piano. The French cuisine is good, but it's best known for Angelina Jolie's haunt while filming "Tomb Raider."</p>

                  <p><strong>Floating Village - Tonle Sap Lake</strong></p>
                  <p>Tonle Sap Lake is the largest body of fresh water in South East Asia. Its dimension changes depending on the monsoon and dry season. More than three million inhabit the banks of the Lake and 90% of them earn a living by catching fish.</p>

                  <p><strong>Kulen Waterfall</strong></p>
                  <p>Kulen is considered by Khmers to be the most sacred mountain in Cambodia and it is a popular place for domestic visitors during weekends and festivals. On the hilltop there are 56 Angkorian temples made of bricks and volcanic stones.</p>

                  <p><strong>Angkor National Museum</strong></p>
                  <p>Angkor National Museum is composed of eight separate galleries, all connected by a vaulted corridor with a series of fountains and lined with what seems like all the Angkorian limestone lion and demon heads missing from statues at the temples.</p>
